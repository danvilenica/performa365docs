* **Self-enrollment**: To self enroll to the course, learners need to choose a course from the catalog and select the *Enroll* action button in the sidebar of the course page.. If the visibility of the course is set to *View only*, learners will not be able to enroll to the course.
* **administrative enrollment**: When learners are administrativelly enrolled to a course, they receive an e-mail notification informing them of this action. The course will become visible in their learning plan and they will be able to access its activities.
